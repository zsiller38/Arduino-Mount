# Arduino-Mount

## Planning

### Idea
Our idea is to create a little ramp and use our servo to hit a ball up that ramp. There will be a small hole at the top that the ball can go in. 

### Schedule
Ramp and base: Zac

Legs to hold it up:

Ball return path: 

Servo module with paddle: 

Arduino wiring plan:

Connection points:

Final assembly:

Building it in real life:
