# Arduino-Mount

## Planning

### Idea
Our idea is to create a little ramp and use our servo to hit a ball up that ramp. There will be a small hole at the top that the ball can go in. 

### Schedule
Ramp and base: done

Legs to hold it up: done

Rails: done

Button pannel: done

Ball return path: done

Servo module with paddle: done

Arduino and Servo brackets:

Arduino wiring plan:

Final assembly:

Building it in real life:

## Final Thoughts

### Cad
The cad was very simple as it was mostly what we had already done. It was very cool to learn how to edit in context as well as how to insert premade parts like the arduino board.

### Code
Simaler to the Cad, the code was not that hard. It was just a modified 2 buttons one servo code, but we did need to do some tinkering with the servo start position.

### Construction
Construction was by far the hardest part, but it was also really fun. Learning how to cut acrylic was quite interesting as well as 3d printing. We had some trouble getting our 3d printed rails to fit together, so in the future I would probably try to avoid perfect fits with 3d printed parts. Overall the product was very fun and I really enjoyed engineering 1.
